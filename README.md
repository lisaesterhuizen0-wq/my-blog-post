Learning to Code in a Season I Didn’t Expect 

As a stay-at-home mom of two under two, finding time to pivot from what was already a short-lived career wasn’t simple. I started learning front-end development to fill the need to do something mentally stimulating that could also hold a reward in the long run — unlike my gaming and Sudoku hobbies. 

As a mom, me-time is a luxury. You want to do something you enjoy, but this is also the only time you have to work toward something meaningful. 

This article is about how I was able to fulfil both of those desires when I started my journey into web development, and the practical habits that helped me stick with it during this season of my life. 

 

I have always been someone who loves math, logic, and deep thinking. I always imagined myself working a mentally stimulating job with lots of variety and challenges. 

I used to be one of those people who said, “I could never work behind a screen all day.” Now, I find it hard when everyday life pulls me away from it. 

I also assumed front-end development would be boring and that if I could just get through the HTML and CSS part, I might enjoy the deeper stuff like JavaScript or Python. 

I was wrong. 

Learning HTML and CSS has been so much fun. 

The practical, hands-on nature of it has kept me invested and excited to carve out time for myself. It always feels like time I’ve invested in myself and my future skills. And as a mom, committing to something every day can be hard. 

 

Three things that really helped me stay consistent: 

1. I aim for at least 30 minutes a day 

Sometimes that doesn’t happen. Sometimes it doesn’t happen for three days — and that’s okay. Having a small daily goal makes it easier to return. Keeping the time commitment short removes pressure and lowers the barrier to starting. 

2. It’s not something I have to do 

I do this for me. I do it because I enjoy it. There are no strict deadlines, which gives me space to explore, experiment, and play. It makes learning feel lighter and more sustainable. 

3. Don’t stay stuck in the struggle 

I enjoy trying to figure things out on my own, but spending 30 minutes stuck on a tiny syntax error can be discouraging. Now, when I’m stuck, I use AI tools to help me spot mistakes faster. 

The key for me is: use AI, don’t abuse AI. 
Understand the mistake. Learn from it. Remember the correction. 

 

Practical habits that help: 

Save your projects and assignments 
No matter how small, I save everything. Being able to look back and see progress is incredibly motivating. 

Handwritten notes 
Writing things down has helped me remember syntax and concepts far better than typing. It slows me down in a good way and deepens understanding. 

Smaller notebooks (A5 instead of A4) 
Smaller pages feel less overwhelming, more organized, and easier to carry around. This small change made notetaking feel manageable again. 

Thinking long-term 

We live in a digital, tech-driven world. I want to understand the language of it. I want my kids to grow up seeing this as normal. I believe tech literacy is becoming as essential as basic literacy. 

Whether I turn this into a career or not, learning to code feels like a valuable investment. 

And honestly… 

It’s kind of cool.
